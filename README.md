## It is the good old 2048-game implemented with react-native.

The gameplay hasn't changed much but all the tiles were presented  in the form of logos of the most popular cryptocurrencies. In addition, all the crypto-currencies are sorted according to their market capitalization. So in the end, by manipulating the tiles, you need to collect the most expensive coin - Bitcoin.

### Features:
- Single-player sliding block puzzle game
- New stunning design of the old game
- Tiles distribution, according to the capitalization of the cryptocurrency
- Easy gameplay
- Only for real crypto geeks

You can download and install the app from [Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coins2048).

This project was bootstrapped with [Expo CLI](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html).

Feel free to clone the repo and experiment with the game!
